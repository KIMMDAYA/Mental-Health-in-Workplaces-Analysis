## Problem Statement:
In the evolving landscape of work environments, particularly with the rise of remote and hybrid models, it's crucial to understand how these changes affect employee mental health and overall well-being. This analysis aims to identify patterns and correlations between work arrangements and mental health outcomes to inform organizational policies and support systems.


## Objective:
To analyze the impact of different work locations (remote, hybrid, onsite) on employees' mental health conditions, stress levels, work-life balance, and job satisfaction across various demographics and job roles.

## Tools Used
- Excel: Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation

## Dataset
Source: {Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health)
- Content: Employee mental health conditions, work location (remote, hybrid, onsite), work-life balance scores, stress levels, and company support.

## Data Cleaning in Excel
1.	Imported dataset into Excel.
2.	Handled missing values by removing or imputing where necessary.
3.	Formatted data types for consistency.
4.	Created calculated fields to derive new insights, such as the percentage of employees experiencing mental health issues.

## Power BI Dashboard Creation
1.	Loaded cleaned data from Excel into Power BI.
2.	Created key visualizations: 
-	KPI Cards: Employee count, percentage of mental health cases, average work-life balance score, and mental health access rate.
-	Bar Chart: Mental health conditions categorized by work location.
-	Line Chart: Hours worked vs. average work-life balance score.
-	Map Visualization: Stress levels by region.
-	Pie Chart: Virtual meetings vs. stress levels.
-	Clustered Bar Chart: Company support vs. mental health.
3.	Implemented filters & slicers for Region, Stress Level, Gender,to allow dynamic exploration.

2.	Improve Work-Life Balance: Encourage reasonable working hours and flexible schedules.
3.	Increase Remote Work Satisfaction: Address communication gaps and promote virtual team engagement.
4.	Reduce Meeting Fatigue: Optimize the number of virtual meetings to avoid unnecessary stress.
5.	Strengthen Remote Work Policies: Ensure career development opportunities for remote and hybrid workers.

## Conclusion
